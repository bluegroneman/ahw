## Our Gracious Donors
The Almost Home Wyoming organization is entirely ran by volunteers, so it is with great gratitude that we extend a thank you to our generous donors.

The [LOR Foundation](https://lorfoundation.org/) along with [Ami Vincent](https://lorfoundation.org/people/ami-vincent) for the very generous grant money we received to ease the burden of homelessness in Lander!
We are humbled by your commitment to make our community a better place for all.

The Wyoming Community Foundation has continued to support us year over year through the match event known as Challenge for Charities. You can read more about it [here](https://www.landercommunityfoundation.org/challenge-for-charities-overview).
This thriving event has kept us motivated and being able to financially support out clients year over year. Our whole community is in a better place because of what this event enables us to acoomplish.

Through the help of our vibrant Lander community we are able to continue our mission of helping the homeless population of Lander, and that is the greatest gift of all.
